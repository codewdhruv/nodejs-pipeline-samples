In this tutorial you will learn how you can seamlessly get started with Harness CI for Nodejs. In this pipeline we will be implementing a ```Hello World Server``` in Nodejs.

### Step 1: Create your Harness Project

- Move to the Harness Platform & click on ```Project``` -> ```New Project```

- Configure the project settings as below

``` Name: (Default Project Name) ```
``` Organization: Default ```

- Select CI Module in the modules sections

### Step 2: Pipeline Creation & Configure Stages

- Click on ```Pipelines``` -> Create a ```Pipeline```

- Configure the pipeline as below

``` Name: CI-Nodejs-Quickstart ```

``` Set up pipeline as: Inline ```

To know more about Pipelines [check out the docs here](https://github.com/harness-community/nodejs-pipeline-samples/docs) Next, we are going to add Stages and steps to our Pipeline and build our Nodejs sample server.
